The Console-Based Bookstore Management System is a straightforward console application designed to simulate the operations of a bookstore. Users can register using their phone number, log in, browse books, and purchase a single book at a time. The system supports payment through UPI or cash, providing a focused experience for users. This project serves as an excellent introduction to core Java concepts.


## Key Features:-

- 1.User Authentication:

  Registration: Users register by providing their phone number as a username and setting a password. Validation ensures that the phone number is unique and correctly formatted. 
    
     Login: Users log in using their phone number and password to access the bookstore
-  2.Book Selection: Users can browse a list of available books and select one book to purchase at a time. Java Collections like ArrayList are used to manage the inventory of books. Switch statements are employed to navigate through the menu options.
- 3.Single Book Purchase: The system is designed for users to purchase only one book per transaction.After selecting a book, the user is directed to checkout.
- 4.Order Processing: At checkout, users can choose between two payment methods: UPI or cash. The system calculates the total price for the selected book and processes the payment accordingly.
- 5.Core Java Concepts: The project showcases key Java concepts, including method recursion for handling tasks like menu navigation, exception handling for managing invalid inputs, and basic OOP principles to structure the application.
- 6.Billing System: Upon confirming the purchase, the system generates a bill that includes the title of the purchased book and the total cost. The chosen payment method is also recorded in the bill.


## Technologies Used:-
- Core Java
- Collections Framework
- Exception Handling
- OOP's Principles
## Conclusion
The Console-Based Bookstore Management System is an ideal project for beginners, focusing on fundamental Java programming skills. The system allows users to register, log in, and purchase one book at a time, with payment options for UPI or cash. This project offers hands-on experience with essential Java concepts in a straightforward, easy-to-manage application.
